=== Enable jQuery Migrate Helper ===
Contributors: wordpressdotorg, Clorith
Tested up to: 5.5
Stable tag: 0.1.0
License: GPLv2 or late
Requires PHP: 5.6

== Description ==

With the update to WordPress 5.5, a migration tool known as `jquery-migrate` will no longer be enabled by default. This may lead to unexpected behaviors in some themes or plugins who run older code.

This plugin serves as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.
3. That's it! The plugin handles the rest automatically for you.
