== Description ==

With the update to WordPress 5.5, a migration tool known as `jquery-migrate` will no longer be enabled by default. This may lead to unexpected behaviors in some themes or plugins who run older code.

This plugin serves as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does it mean that something is "deprecated" =
A script, a file, or some other piece of code is deprecated when its developers are in the process of replacing it with more modern code or removing it entirely.
