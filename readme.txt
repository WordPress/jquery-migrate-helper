== Description ==

With the update to WordPress 5.5, a migration tool known as `jquery-migrate` will no longer be enabled by default. This may lead to unexpected behaviors in some themes or plugins who run older code.

This plugin serves as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.
3. That's it! The plugin handles the rest automatically for you.

= v 1.0.0 =
